            <p>
                We adopted Cherry on July 10,2015, One month after i was done with my secondary school,
                We went to the Animal shelter to look for a dog to celebrate me done with high school.
                Cherry was 1year old, when we got her in our life for 7 more years. She lived in three homes with us welcomed two little
                member into our family and forever left her paws prints in our heart.
